				Recent developments in image-making techniques have resulted in a drastic blurring of the threshold
				between the world of the image and the real world. Immersive and interactive virtual environments (VEs)
				have enabled the production of pictures that elicit an unprecedented reality effect, creating in the
				perceiver a strong feeling of “being there”, namely of being incorporated into a quasi-real world. In
				doing so, they conceal their material mediateness (by simulating immediateness), their separateness (by
				aiming at unframedness), and their referentiality (by emphasizing presentness), paradoxically
				challenging their status as images, i.e. as icons: they are veritable “an-icons”. Subjects relating to
				an-icons are no longer visual observers of images isolated from the real world by a framing device (be
				it the pedestal of a statue, the frame of a painting, or the cinema screen); they are experiencers
				living in a quasi-real space-time that offers multisensory and synaesthetic stimuli and allows
				interactive sensorimotor affordances, promoting an environmentalization of the image.

				Nowadays, these experiencers are digital natives who grow up interacting with touch screens from their
				earliest years; but in relation to immersive VEs they are still “immigrants” who need to acquire
				familiarity with an-iconic transformations of sensibility. However, given the pace of technological
				development and the huge amount of economic and scientific investments in virtual reality (VR) on a
				global scale, digital aniconic natives are to be expected in a very near future. Head Mounted Displays
				(HMD) are already in use as new interfaces for personal computers (Oculus Rift and HTC Vive) and video
				game consoles (Sony PlayStation VR), or mimicked by low-budget smartphone wearables (Google Cardboard
				and Samsung Gear VR). Virtual Retinal Displays (VRD, like Magic Leap One) and increasingly cheaper and
				standalone devices (Oculus Go) have already been released in 2018.

				AN-ICON aims to develop “an-iconology” as a new paradigm able to address this challenging iconoscape.
				Because of the complexity of such an iconoscape, its approach needs to be articulated in a
				transdisciplinary way and to adopt a transmedial perspective. The project will be structured in three
				tightly interconnected Research Clusters: A) HISTORY: a media-historical investigation will provide a
				taxonomy of the manifold an-iconic strategies and dispositifs (e.g. illusionistic painting,
				pre-cinematic devices, 3D films, videogames, head mounted displays), taking at the same time into
				consideration significant countertendencies; B) THEORY: drawing on phenomenology, visual culture studies
				and techno-aesthetics, the research will clarify the specific nature of an-iconic involvements and
				identify the key concepts for their understanding; C) PRACTICES: a socio-cultural section will explore
				the impact of an-iconic environments on contemporary professional domains as well as on everyday life.
				An-iconic applications have become a cutting-edge topic, raising ethical, legal, and socio-political
				issues that will be specifically addressed by the project. Assuming the fundamental historicity of
				perception, AN-ICON will tackle this urgent challenge that is going to radically change human relations
				to images and to experience as a whole. The three clusters will converge towards the following
				overarching question: to what extent is this new iconoscape promoting a novel interplay between the body
				and technology, and so modifying human sensibility in its individual and social articulations?

						The Seminar of Philosophy of Image is a research group which aims at investigating contemporary
						issues in aesthetics and visual culture. The Serminar organises meetings with international
						speakers
						open to all public. Each gathering consists of a talk and a session of Q&A.

						The Seminar has a transdisciplinary approach, but retains firm roots in philosophical
						disciplines.
						Therefore, we host contributions by scholars coming from, but not limited to anthropology,
						history
						of art, media studies, philosophy, psychology, and visual culture studies.

						Scientific Coordinator: Prof. Andrea Pinotti
						Organizing Committee: Federica Cavaletti, Pietro Conte, Anna Caterina Dalmasso, Giancarlo
						Grossi,
						Giacomo Mercuriali.

						From 2019 to 2024, the Seminar of Philosophy of Image is integrated into the activities of the
						ERC
						Advanced Grant AN-ICON. An-Iconology: History, Theory, and Practices of Environmental Images
						coordinated by prof. Andrea Pinotti.

					<h3 class="subsection-title">Illusion</h3>
					<p>When dealing with environments that simulate reality, illusion is one of the first concepts that
						must be tackled. Yet how is illusion to be interpreted? Is it an unconscious deception
						accomplished through a false perception, or is it rather a lusory attitude adopted in a peculiar
						kind of make-believe relation? What is the difference between illusion, deception, and
						hallucination? How does illusion turn into deception? How does deception become illusion?

						Despite it has been traditionally given a negative value, the word “illusion” is currently
						accorded a more and more positive meaning as one of the most important objectives of the
						creators and experiencers of an-icons. Should we speak of emulation when, for instance,
						psychiatrists treat veterans and depressed elders by plunging them in alternative worlds? Is
						simulation the aim of political communicators who manipulate images supposed to represent
						reality? What are the challenges raised by so-called deepfakes? Is a perfect environmental
						illusion also the ultimate objective of videogame designers?

						The effect of illusion presupposes techniques that negate or dissimulate the mediateness of the
						image, making transparent the threshold between reality and image. The deriving “environmental”
						images presuppose the interaction with the observers; but is interactivity necessary to obtain
						an illusion effect? Does the multisensory quality of the interaction affect the overall illusion
						effect? And, since environmental images are frequently inhabited by the users’ proxies: do
						avatars in their vast phenomenology enhance the illusion, or rather do they diminish the
						resulting effect? What is the relation between illusion and the style of the image? Is
						hyper-realism a necessary element of illusion, simulation, and immersivity?</p>
